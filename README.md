In the Challenge I learned more of how to debug. Before debuging the dogs were spainging at the top of the screen, the player was spawining green balls instead of dogs, the balls were destroyed if anywhere near the dog, nothing was being destroyed off screen, only one type of ball was being spawned, the spawn interval was always the same, and the player could spam the spacebar key.

Challenge Outcome:
- A random ball (of 3) is generated at a random x position above the screen
- When the user presses spacebar, a dog is spawned and runs to catch the ball
- If the dog collides with the ball, the ball is destroyed
- If the ball hits the ground, a “Game Over” debug message is displayed
- The dogs and balls are removed from the scene when they leave the screen
